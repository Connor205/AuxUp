# AuxUp
AuxUp was the winning project from the UCD Startathon hosted by NOVA UCD during the fall of 2019. 
# Main Pitch
All of the code and content from the app idea AuxUp. AuxUp is a mobile based platform that will allow everyone to listen to their music in public settings. 
Using the app will have hosts create rooms that anyone can join with a code. Once part of a room users will be able to add songs from their own personal music libraries to the queue and vote on songs that they want to see played. 
It is the first step toward the democratization of music everywhere from parties to car rides.
